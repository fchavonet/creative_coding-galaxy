# Galaxy

## Description

This project is a creative coding exploration built with `p5.js`, simulating a rotating spiral galaxy composed of thousands of dynamically animated stars.

Each particle follows a procedurally generated orbit around a radiant galactic core, forming an evolving three-dimensional structure reminiscent of real astronomical systems.

Developed as a study in generative design, particle dynamics, and interactive WebGL rendering, Galaxy demonstrates how complex, organic motion can emerge from simple mathematical rules within a browser environment.

## Objectives

Build a 3D galaxy simulation using `p5.js`.
Experiment with particle motion, angular velocity, and depth-based fading.
Offer a visually immersive experience with minimal code dependencies.

## What's Next?

- Add nebula-like color fogs and particle glows for a more cinematic feel.
- Implement mouse or camera interaction for dynamic navigation within the galaxy.
- Optimize rendering for mobile and tablet devices.
- Experiment with audio-reactive visuals.

## Thanks

- Thanks to the p5.js community for documentation and inspiration.
- Special thanks to developers sharing creative coding projects online, their work made this exploration possible.
